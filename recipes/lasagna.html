        <h2>What's In Hearty Vegetable Lasagna</h2>
        <p>As its title aptly illustrates, this Vegetable Lasagna features a number of tender vegetables! The components
            of
            the dish are reminiscent of traditional lasagna, with red sauce and a creamy cheesy filling. My favorite
            combination of vegetables for this lasagna is zucchini, carrots, spinach, and
            mushrooms. The zucchini and carrots need a quick boil to tenderize them before being added to the dish, but
            the
            spinach and the mushrooms go into the dish raw. It all cooks together resulting in a savory and tender bite
            each
            time!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
